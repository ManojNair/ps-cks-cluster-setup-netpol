# 🎙️ Clip 2: Creating Network Policies – Ingress Rules (Narration Script v4)

---

## Opening Context – The Lab Environment  

**(Tone: friendly and conversational)**  
Before we dive in — let me quickly talk about the environment I’ll be using for all the demos in this course... **Killerkoda**.

**(Pause)**  
Killerkoda gives you a fully interactive environment designed specifically for practicing Kubernetes scenarios —   
and the best part?  
It’s almost an exact replica of the **Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist**, or **CKS**, exam experience.

**(Slight emphasis)**  
Now, you might be wondering — *why does that matter?*  

Well, during the real exam, you’re not running things on your powerful local machine.  
You’re connected to a **remote desktop** environment — and that means performance can sometimes feel… a little sluggish.  

Plus, you won’t have your favorite tools like **VS Code**, or your customized terminal setup with all your aliases and themes.  

**(Pause)**  
So getting used to that exam-style setup early really helps.  

The good news? In both the exam and Killerkoda, you can simply use **`k`** instead of `kubectl`.  
Bash autocompletion is already configured — which is a *huge* time-saver.  

And if you need documentation, you’ll have Firefox access to **kubernetes.io**.  
Later in this course, I’ll show you some quick **navigation and time-saving tips** that make a real difference in your score.  

If you want to follow along, I recommend using either **Killerkoda** or your own practice cluster —   
maybe **Docker Desktop with KIND**, or **Minikube**.  

Personally, I prefer Killerkoda — and just to be clear, I’m not affiliated with them in any way.  
It just helps me stay familiar with the exam experience and avoid fumbling between windows or docs.

**(Pause, transition)**  
Now before we begin writing our policies — one quick note.  
In this clip, we’ll be **crafting** our Network Policies, but we won’t actually test them yet.  
Right now, I want you to focus entirely on the **syntax** and the **core concepts**.  
We’ll test and validate these policies in a later clip once we’ve built a solid foundation.

**(Pause for transition)**  
Alright — with that out of the way, let’s get hands-on with **Network Policies**.

## Creating Network Policies – Ingress Rules

Let’s roll up our sleeves and actually create some Network Policies.  
We’ll walk through a few real-world examples — and I’ll explain each YAML file, line by line, so it all clicks.

---

### Demo Setup  

We’ll start with a simple **three-tier app** — frontend, backend, and database.  

Make sure your cluster’s CNI supports Network Policies — like **Calico**, **Cilium**, or **Weave Net**.

**(Instructional tone)**  
Let’s open our terminal and create a new namespace called *production-app*:  

```bash
kubectl create namespace production-app
```

**(Voiceover)**  
Once that’s done, let’s spin up three pods — one for each tier of the application.  

```bash
kubectl run frontend --image=nginx --labels=tier=frontend -n production-app
kubectl run backend --image=nginx --labels=tier=backend -n production-app
kubectl run database --image=nginx --labels=tier=database -n production-app
```

**(Calm pacing)**  
This creates three NGINX pods labeled `frontend`, `backend`, and `database`.  
Right now, all of them can freely talk to each other.  

**(Pause)**  
That’s... not great for security. Let’s lock that down.

---

### Example 1: Default Deny Ingress Policy  

Let’s start with our **first policy** — a *default deny ingress* policy.  
And this time, instead of memorizing YAML, we’ll do it the *exam way* — using the **official Kubernetes documentation**.

**(Instructional tone)**  
Let’s open **Firefox** inside Killerkoda and go to **kubernetes.io**.  
In the search bar, type **“netpol.”**

**(Pause)**  
On the right-hand side, under **Default policies**, you’ll see an example titled *Default deny all ingress traffic*.  
Click it, and copy the sample YAML from that page.

**(Encouraging tone)**  
This is an important habit to build for the exam — rather than trying to memorize,  
know **where** to find snippets and how to adapt them quickly.  

Now, back in your terminal, let’s paste that into a file called `default-deny-ingress.yaml`.  
It should look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-ingress
  namespace: production-app
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

Let’s break this down.

- `apiVersion` — `networking.k8s.io/v1` is stable since Kubernetes 1.7.  
- `metadata` — defines name and namespace; remember, **Network Policies are namespaced**.  
- `podSelector: {}` — those empty braces mean “apply to *all* pods in this namespace.”  
- And `policyTypes: - Ingress` — we’re targeting incoming traffic.

Now — notice there are no `ingress` rules here.  
**No rules means no traffic allowed.** That’s our **default deny**.

**(Voiceover)**  
Let’s go ahead and apply this policy:  

```bash
kubectl apply -f default-deny-ingress.yaml
```

You should see output saying “networkpolicy/default-deny-ingress created.”  
That means all pods are now isolated for ingress — nothing can connect *in*.  
Egress is still open, which is fine for now.

---

### Example 2: Allow Frontend to Backend  

Next, let’s allow a specific communication path — frontend to backend on port 80.  

**(Voiceover)**  
Create a new file called `backend-allow-frontend.yaml` and paste this in:  

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: backend-allow-frontend
  namespace: production-app
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          tier: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

**(Calm explanation)**  
Here’s what’s happening:  

- `podSelector` targets pods labeled `tier=backend`.  
- Under `ingress: from:`, we allow traffic only from pods labeled `tier=frontend`.  
- Since there’s no `namespaceSelector`, this applies just within the same namespace.  
- And finally, port 80 for TCP traffic is explicitly allowed.  

**(Voiceover)**  
Let’s apply it:  

```bash
kubectl apply -f backend-allow-frontend.yaml
```

You should see confirmation that the policy was created.  
Now only the frontend can talk to the backend on port 80 — and nothing else.

---

### Example 3: Allow Backend to Database  

Now we’ll connect the backend to the database — port 3306 for MySQL.  

**(Voiceover)**  
Create a file named `database-allow-backend.yaml` and add:  

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: database-allow-backend
  namespace: production-app
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: database
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          tier: backend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

Same structure, but this time for the database layer.

**(Voiceover)**  
Let’s apply this one too:  

```bash
kubectl apply -f database-allow-backend.yaml
```

Now we have a clear, layered policy chain:  
Frontend → Backend (80)  
Backend → Database (3306)  
Everything else is blocked.

---

### Summary  

Let’s recap what we learned.  

We started by copying a **default deny ingress** policy directly from **kubernetes.io**,  
then gradually opened up specific paths.  
This reflects the **least privilege** model in Kubernetes.  

Key takeaways:  
- `podSelector` defines which pods the policy targets.  
- `policyTypes` tells Kubernetes if it’s controlling ingress, egress, or both.  
- And `ingress` rules specify **who** can connect and **on which ports**.  

That **deny-by-default** mindset is essential — both for **real-world clusters** and for the **CKS exam**.  
And remember — you don’t have to memorize YAML.  
Just know how to find and adapt it quickly on **kubernetes.io**.

**(Pause, confident close)**  
Nice work — let’s move on.
